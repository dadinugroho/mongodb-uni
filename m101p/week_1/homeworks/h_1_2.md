# Step by step solution

1. [Optional] If you want to make sure you have fresh data you can download the zip file from homework 1.1 then extract it. Go to the folder inside and restore it using ```mongoretore --drop -d m101 dump```. ```--drop``` to drop previous data and `-d` is to indicate the database used to restore the dump.
2. Go to the downloaded location of ```hw1-1.py``` then type  ```python hw1-2.py```. You will get the result as expected. Make sure you install python 2 version. Otherwise, you will get some errors.
