# Homework 1.3

We are now going to test that you have bottle installed correctly and can run a bottle-based project. Download the handout and run it as follows:
```javascript
python hw1-3.py
```

It requires that:

bottle be installed correctly
your mongodb to be running
you have run mongorestore properly
From a different terminal window type the following from the command line: ```curl http://localhost:8080/hw1/50```

Alternatively, you can put the url above into your web browser.

Type the two-digit answer into the box below (no spaces).

# Step by step solution

Nothing needed to be done, if you continue from previous step you just need to type in the browser and you will get the answer. Documents on installing python, bottle and mongodb would be available separately.
