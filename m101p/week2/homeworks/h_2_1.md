# Homework 2.1

In this problem, you will be using a collection of student scores that is similar to what we used in the lessons. Please download grades.json from the Download Handout link and import it into your local mongo database as follows:
```javascript
mongoimport --drop -d students -c grades grades.json
```

The dataset contains 4 scores for 200 students.

First, let's confirm your data is intact; the number of documents should be 800.
```javascript
use students
db.grades.count()
```
You should get **800**.

This next query, which uses the aggregation framework that we have not taught yet, will tell you the student_id with the highest average score:
```javascript
db.grades.aggregate({'$group':{'_id':'$student_id', 'average':{$avg:'$score'}}}, {'$sort':{'average':-1}}, {'$limit':1})
```

The answer should be student_id **164** with an average of approximately **89.3**.

Now it's your turn to analyze the data set. Find all exam scores greater than or equal to 65, and sort those scores from lowest to highest.

What is the student_id of the lowest exam score above 65?

# Step by Step Solution
1. Use ```students``` database, and start with display all data in ```grades```.
```javascript
use students;
db.grades.find().pretty();
```

2. We are not yet solving the question. Next, we need to find all exam scores greater than or equal to 65. Means the type => exam and scores >= 65.
```javascript
db.grades.find({'type' : 'exam', 'score' " {'$gte' : 65}}).pretty();
```

3. Wait, we are not finished yet. Now, we have all exam scores greater than or equal to 65. But, we do not sort it yet. We need to sort from lowest to highest. In addition, we can add ```limit(1)``` since the question is what is the student's id of the lowest score above 65?
```javascript
db.grades.find({'type' : 'exam', 'score' " {'$gte' : 65}})sort({'score' : 1}).limit(1).pretty();
```

You can see the answer now...
